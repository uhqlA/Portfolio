        I hold a PHD in Conservation ecology and entomology from the
        International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) and
        Stellenbosch University whereby I was analyzing the effects of the
        landscape matrix on honeybee colony integrity. I also have a
        demonstrated history of working in international research organizations.
        I am skilled in Remote sensing techniques using Google Earth Engine,
        SNAP and other platforms, Statistical Analysis using R, GIS Analytical
        Skills, Digital Mapping, Natural Resource Management, and honeybee
        science. I am a strong research professional who is easily integrated
